            Hello! I'm <b>Pratyay</b>, a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer with a solid foundation in software design, development, databases, and web technologies. 
            My journey in the field of Information Technology has been both exciting and enriching, driven by a deep curiosity and a constant desire to learn and grow. 
            With a Master’s degree in Information Systems Technologies from Wilmington University and a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Gujarat 
            Technological University, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from developing complex client-server communication systems to designing intuitive 
            database management solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            My technical expertise spans across various programming languages, including Java, C, and Python, as well as frameworks like Spring Boot. I am proficient in testing 
            frameworks such as JUnit and cloud orchestration using Virtual Machines. My hands-on experience with databases like Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, and MySQL, coupled with 
            my knowledge of tools like Git, Linux, Docker, and AWS, has equipped me with the skills to tackle challenging IT problems.
        </p>
            Beyond my professional work, I am a certified RedHat System Administrator and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner, which further reflects my commitment to mastering 
            industry-relevant skills. I have also actively contributed to academic projects, such as developing a Salon Management System using SQL and designing an E-commerce 
            platform with Django and Python.
        
        <p>
            Currently, I am embarking on an exciting new adventure—learning Web Development! This new pursuit is driven by my love for creating and a desire to expand my 
            expertise into front-end technologies. I am diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and dynamic websites. As I continue to evolve in my career, 
            I am excited to integrate my backend skills with modern web development practices, creating comprehensive and seamless user experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I am not coding, you might find me engaging in community events, exploring new innovations and technologies, or delving into activities that keep me energized 
            and balanced. I believe in staying ahead of the curve and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new and challenging. Outside of academics, I find 
            joy in reading books that broaden my perspective, listening to captivating podcasts that spark curiosity, and further honing my coding skills in Java. I am also an 
            avid sports enthusiast, with a love for playing badminton, cricket, and soccer.
